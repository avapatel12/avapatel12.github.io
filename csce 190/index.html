                            Students who walk to class everyday face difficulties with getting lost, knowing what time they need to leave in order to arrive at their destination on time, and ensuring that they are taking the most efficient route. When beginning college, students are often left to just figure it out on their own without any real guidance or an in-depth understanding of how the campus is laid out thus causing extra and unnecessary tardiness, stress, and confusion.

                            My group and I worked together to come up with a bunch of ideas to elevate the experience of using Class Clock. We definitely advanced and evolved the concept to not just inputing a class schedule into an app to reduce tardines, but to also be a game, locator, and social media platform.
